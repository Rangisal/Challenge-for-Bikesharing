# Challenge-for-Bikesharing

# Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this project is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for a different cities. There are so many factors we need to considerate along with the trip duration. Trip duration is one of the main and important factors out of all the factors. Finding out how long the trips are in the month of August as the month of august is the peak month in summer will give us a good analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are the most popular times to rent a bike and are there any gender-based analysis also take place in terms of renting the bikes. The main CSV folder has been changed to a new CSV file with the trip duration consists with hours, minutes and seconds.
